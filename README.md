# LUG Helper
**Star Citizen's Linux Users Group Helper Script**  
https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/LUG

### *Greetings, fellow Penguin!*
_**This script is designed to help you manage and optimize Star Citizen on Linux.**_

Zenity menus are used for a GUI experience with a fallback to terminal-based menus where Zenity is unavailable.  
Command line arguments are available for quickly launching functions from the terminal.  

Configuration is saved in *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/starcitizen-lug/*  
Keybinds are backed up to *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/starcitizen-lug/keybinds/*

## Options

`Preflight Check`
- Runs a series of system optimization checks and offers to fix any issues
  - Checks that vm.max_map_count is set to at least 16777216
    - This sets the maxmimum number of "memory map areas" a process can have. While most applications need less than a thousand maps, Star Citizen requires access to more
  - Checks that the hard open file descriptors limit is set to at least 524288
    - This limits the maximum number of open files on your system.  On some Linux distributions, the default is set too low for Star Citizen
